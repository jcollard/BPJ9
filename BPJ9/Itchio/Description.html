<h2>A Geomancer's Tale</h2>
<p>A village of Geomancers live in the cold mountains to the north.
    The ability to harness the power of the elements is not easy and its
    secrets are kept amongst them. When a member of their group reaches the

    It is Ukia's 16th birthday and they must now complete their first trial.
